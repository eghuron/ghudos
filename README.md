# GhuDos
A simple representation of dos, only for fun. I need to study calculus...

run the main.py and have fun.

I added a todo list, so if you wanna improve it, go ahead!

# Patch notes:

v1.0.1 - When I was trying to create a subdirectory with the CRDIR command inside a directory I would get an error. Now everything is fine
